## Introduction

Welcome to the AI-Assisted Culinary Robot project! This project, led by Asil and Revanth as part of our university's final project, explores the convergence of food preparation, culinary robots, and artificial intelligence (AI). We have developed a computer vision model that excels in component recognition and meal selection, aiming to empower individuals to create delicious meals using ingredients they already have at home.

## Key Features

- Utilizes the power of OpenAI's GPT-4 model.
- Incorporates a vast library of over 20,000 culinary recipes.
- Accurately identifies ingredients and offers creative recipe ideas.
- Advances the field of AI-assisted cooking, enhancing culinary experiences.
